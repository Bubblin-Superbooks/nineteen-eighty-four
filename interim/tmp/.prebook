His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died\nloving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and\nbecause somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a\nconception of loyalty that was private and unalterable.

Or\nagain, 'The Times' of the nineteenth of December had published the official\nforecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the\nfourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth\nThree-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output,\nfrom which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly\nwrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them\nagree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very\nsimple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short\na time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise\n(a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would be\nno reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984.

This process of continuous alteration was applied\nnot only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters,\nleaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind of\nliterature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or\nideological significance.

He could not follow the figures, but he was\naware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged\nout a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.\nWith the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to\nfill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he\nheld carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and\nhe had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to\nthe remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the\ntelescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank\nBig Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And\nonly yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was\nto be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could\nswallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons\nswallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature\nat the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious\ndesire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that\nlast week the ration had been thirty grammes.

Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort\nof protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had\na right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly\ndifferent. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never\nbeen quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that\nwere not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,\nrooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,\nbread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes\ninsufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,\nof course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this\nwas NOT the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the\ndiscomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness\nof one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty\nsoap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil\ntastes?

Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people\nin Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured.

    "p": "That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the\nParty textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles\nfrom bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by\nthe capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced\nto work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a\nmatter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age\nof six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the\nParty taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in\nsubjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In\nreality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to\nknow much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other\nactivities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned\nloose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life\nthat appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were\nborn, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed\nthrough a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married\nat twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part,\nat sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty\nquarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling,\nfilled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not\ndifficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them,\nspreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few\nindividuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt\nwas made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not\ndesirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that\nwas required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to\nwhenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or\nshorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes\ndid, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas,\nthey could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils\ninvariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even\nhave telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them\nvery little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole\nworld-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and\nracketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles\nthemselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were\nallowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the\nParty was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce\nwas permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been\npermitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.\nThey were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: 'Proles and\nanimals are free.'",

They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.\nThe Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public\nevent to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that\nthere were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal\nif not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their\nfolly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was\nconcerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of\nintricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole\ntribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and\nlucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,\nwhich was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed\neveryone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.\nOnly small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being\nnon-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between\none part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.",

The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling\nthat he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main\nthoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of\nshouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight\nof steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers\nwere selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered\nwhere he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next\nturning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the\nblank book which was now his diary.

As Winston stood watching, it\noccurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had\nalready been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others\nlike him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of\ncapitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas\nhad been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly\nbeen wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few\nwho survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual\nsurrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful\naccount of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a\nprole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into\nhis diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold\nof him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that\nold man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life\nwhen you were a boy. What was it like in those days?

If the\npatrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not\nlikely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous\ncheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of\nvoices dropped to about half its volume.

It was no use. He turned round.\nA blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew,\nwas inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not\nsafe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at\na table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with\na friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his.

It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place\nagain, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance\nto the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the\nafternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung\ntogether, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with\nastonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the\nbird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped\nfor a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its\nspeckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort\nof vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate,\nno rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood\nand pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there\nwas a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in\nlow whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would\npick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,\nbeetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. But by degrees\nthe flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as\nthough it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got\nmixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped\nthinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft\nand warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body\nseemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as\nwater. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard\nkisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again\nboth of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter\nof wings.",

It was a good\nhiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very\ndangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different\nplace every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the\nstreet it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted\ndown the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one\nanother, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked\non and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence\nby the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then\ntaken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly\ncut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without\nintroduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this\nkind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She was\nalso surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in\nalmost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They\nwere passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when\nthey were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the\nearth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his\nside, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at\nhand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his\nown, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was\ndead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live\nwarm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his\nlips.

It paid, she said, it was camouflage.\nIf you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones.

Their first love-making had been\nsimply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The\nsmell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed\nto have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a\nphysical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he\nhad a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling\nthat she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed\nthem together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his\nfingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It\nstruck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment\nmust be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had\nnot felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they\nwere a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were\nwalking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly\nand without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the\nhousehold. He wished above all that they had some place where they could\nbe alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time\nthey met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the\nfollowing day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred\nto him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected\nreadiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were\nintentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the\nedge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.\nIt was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's\nconsciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as\nsurely as 99 precedes 100.

Squads of\nvolunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week,\nstitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and\nperilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers.\nParsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred\nmetres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark.\nThe heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting\nto shorts and an open shirt in the evenings.

He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided,\nleaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of\ncoughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased\nto be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the\ntelescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice.

He usually\nstopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.\nThe old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other\nhand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the\ntiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his\nmeals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient\ngramophone with an enormous horn.

Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and\nthick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had\nalways vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman.\nWith a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or\nthat--a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a\npinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair--never\nasking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To\ntalk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box.\nHe had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of\nforgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and\nanother about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death\nof poor Cock Robin.

But there were also times when they had the illusion\nnot only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in\nthis room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was\ndifficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when\nWinston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that\nit would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside\nit time could be arrested.

Once when he happened in some connexion to mention\nthe war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her\nopinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on\nLondon were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to\nkeep people frightened'. This was an idea that had literally never occurred\nto him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during\nthe Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out\nlaughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they\nin some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept\nthe official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and\nfalsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having\nlearnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own\nschooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the\nhelicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,\nwhen Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one\ngeneration more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he\ntold her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long\nbefore the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After\nall, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more\nof a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did\nnot remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia\nand at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as\na sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy\nhad changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she said\nvaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated\nfrom long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened\nonly four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about\nit for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing\nher memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and\nnot Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as\nunimportant.

Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered\nfrom outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is\nineffectual thereby becomes meaningless.

The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this\ncondition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they\nwere loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not\ndespise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would\none day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed\nhuman.

The square was packed with several thousand people,\nincluding a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the\nSpies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small\nlean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over\nwhich a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little\nRumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the\nmicrophone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony\narm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by\nthe amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres,\ndeportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of\ncivilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was\nalmost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then\nmaddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the\nvoice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose\nuncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all\ncame from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps\ntwenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of\npaper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without\npausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the\ncontent of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different.\nWithout words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.\nOceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous\ncommotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated\nwere all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was\nsabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous\ninterlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds\nand trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in\nclambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from\nthe chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator,\nstill gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward,\nhis free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech.\nOne minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the\ncrowd.

It is a warfare of limited aims between\ncombatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause\nfor fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.\nThis is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing\nattitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.\nOn the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,\nand such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction\nof whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which\nextend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,\nand, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,\nmeritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of\npeople, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few\ncasualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague\nfrontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round\nthe Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In\nthe centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage\nof consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may\ncause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More\nexactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of\nimportance.

None of\nthe three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other\ntwo in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences\nare too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania\nby the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity\nand industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in\na material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of\nself-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared\nto one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of\nprevious wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials\nis no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three\nsuper-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that\nit needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct\neconomic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of\nthe super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,\nthere lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,\nDarwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population\nof the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,\nand of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly\nstruggling.

They add nothing to the wealth of\nthe world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and\nthe object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which\nto wage another war.

The world of today is a bare, hungry,\ndilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and\nstill more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of\nthat period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision of\na future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a\nglittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was\npart of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and\ntechnology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to\nassume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly\nbecause of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and\nrevolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on\nthe empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly\nregimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it\nwas fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various\ndevices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,\nhave been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,\nand the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been\nfully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still\nthere. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it\nwas clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and\ntherefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the\nmachine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,\nilliteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.\nAnd in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of\nautomatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible\nnot to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the\naverage human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at\nthe end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.",

In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to\neat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed\na motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most\nimportant form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once\nbecame general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no\ndoubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal\npossessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER\nremained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such\na society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were\nenjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally\nstupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for\nthemselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later\nrealize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep\nit away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a\nbasis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as\nsome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of\ndoing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency\ntowards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost\nthe whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially\nbackward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated,\ndirectly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.",

This happened to a great extent during\nthe final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy\nof many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation,\ncapital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were\nprevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,\ntoo, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted\nwere obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was\nhow to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real\nwealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be\ndistributed.

War is a way of shattering to pieces,\nor pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea,\nmaterials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,\nand hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are\nnot actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of\nexpending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.\nA Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that\nwould build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as\nobsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with\nfurther enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle\nthe war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might\nexist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs\nof the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is\na chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on\nas an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups\nsomewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity\nincreases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the\ndistinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early\ntwentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere,\nlaborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy\nhis large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the\nbetter quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three\nservants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world\nfrom a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have\na similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call\n'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the\npossession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and\npoverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and\ntherefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste\nseem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.",

But\nthis would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a\nhierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,\nwhose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,\nbut the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is\nexpected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow\nlimits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant\nfanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic\ntriumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality\nappropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is\nactually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does\nnot matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is\nthat a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which\nthe Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an\natmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks\none goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party\nthat war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity\nas an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party\nto know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often\nbe aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or\nis being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such\nknowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK.

In the vast laboratories\nof the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the\nBrazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of\nthe Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work.

Although the Party, according to its\nhabit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as\nearly as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about\nten years later.

All three\npowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against\nthe decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.\nAnd meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or\nforty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing\nplanes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the\nfragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating\nFortress; but otherwise there has been little development.

The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and\nwell-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely\nencircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of\nfriendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years\nas to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic\nbombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all\nbe fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation\nimpossible.

Even if it was still necessary\nfor human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary\nfor them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from\nthe point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,\nhuman equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to\nbe averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was\nin fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of\nan earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of\nbrotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human\nimagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold\neven on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The\nheirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed\nin their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality\nbefore the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be\ninfluenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the\ntwentieth century all the main currents of political thought were\nauthoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the\nmoment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever\nname it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the\ngeneral hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which\nhad been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment\nwithout trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,\ntorture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation\nof whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated\nand even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and\nprogressive.",

But they had been\nforeshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which\nhad appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world\nwhich would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What\nkind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new\naristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,\ntechnicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,\nteachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose\norigins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the\nworking class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of\nmonopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their\nopposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by\nluxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what\nthey were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last\ndifference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the\ntyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups\nwere always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to\nleave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be\nuninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church\nof the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason\nfor this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its\ncitizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,\nmade it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio\ncarried the process further. With the development of television, and\nthe technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit\nsimultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every\ncitizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,\ncould be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police\nand in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of\ncommunication closed.

It had long been realized that the\nonly secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege\nare most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called\n'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of\nthe century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer\nhands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a\ngroup instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the\nParty owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the\nParty owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and\ndisposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the\nRevolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost\nunopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of\ncollectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class\nwere expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the\ncapitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,\ntransport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these\nthings were no longer private property, it followed that they must be\npublic property.

Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of\ncomparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.

Its rulers are not\nheld together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is\ntrue that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what\nat first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to-and-fro\nmovement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or\neven in the pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party\nthere is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure\nthat weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious\nmembers of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise.\nProletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party.

But this\nstate of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of\nprinciple. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word.

The flagstones were wet as though they had just been\nwashed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh\nand pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman\nmarched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling\nsilent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered\nwhether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty\nor thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they\ngazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he\nlooked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching\nup for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him\nfor the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to\nhim that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by\nchildbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the\ngrain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and\nafter all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block\nof granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body\nof a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held\ninferior to the flower?",

That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of\nmouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down\nthere had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile\nbelly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might\neasily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps,\nof wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized\nfruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been\nlaundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending,\nscrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over\nthirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical\nreverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of\nthe pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into\ninterminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same\nfor everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people\nunder the sky were also very much the same--everywhere, all over the world,\nhundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant\nof one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and\nyet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but who\nwere storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that\nwould one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles!\nWithout having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must be\nGoldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could he\nbe sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be\njust as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes,\nbecause at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is\nequality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength\nwould change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not\ndoubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end\ntheir awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a\nthousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,\npassing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share\nand could not kill.",

Why was that? Because\nthe Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while\nthey were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were\nunrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true\nbeliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame\nto the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there\nwere the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis\nand the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly\nthan the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned\nfrom the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not\nmake martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they\ndeliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down\nby torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches,\nconfessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with\nabuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.\nAnd yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.\nThe dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once\nagain, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they\nhad made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of\nthat kind.

We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.\nWe burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our\nside, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of\nourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous\nthought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless\nit may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In\nthe old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming\nhis heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could\ncarry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage\nwaiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it\nout. The command of the old despotisms was \"Thou shalt not\". The command\nof the totalitarians was \"Thou shalt\". Our command is \"THOU ART\". No one\nwhom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed\nclean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once\nbelieved--Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--in the end we broke them down.\nI took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down,\nwhimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain or\nfear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were\nonly the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for\nwhat they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see\nhow they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die\nwhile their minds were still clean.'",

Progress in our world will\nbe progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they\nwere founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world\nthere will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.\nEverything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down\nthe habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We\nhave cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and\nbetween man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend\nany longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.\nChildren will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from\na hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual\nformality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm.\nOur neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except\nloyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of\nBig Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over\na defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When\nwe are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be\nno distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,\nno enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be\ndestroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be\nthe intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing\nsubtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,\nthe sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.

    "p": "Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet\nthe ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984\nthere was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of\ncommunication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in\n'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could\nonly be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would\nhave finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should\ncall it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all\nParty members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions\nmore and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and\nembodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was\na provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic\nformations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,\nperfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,\nthat we are concerned here.",

  "1322": {
    "p": "The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression\nfor the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,\nbut to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that\nwhen Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,\na heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of\nIngsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is\ndependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and\noften very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could\nproperly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the\npossibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly\nby the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable\nwords and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and\nso far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single\nexample. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be\nused in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field is\nfree from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politically\nfree' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no\nlonger existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.\nQuite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction\nof vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be\ndispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend\nbut to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly\nassisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.",

    "p": "Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though\nmany Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,\nwould be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak\nwords were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,\nthe B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.\nIt will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical\npeculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to\nthe A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.",

The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the\nbusiness of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working,\nputting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,\ngardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words\nthat we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,\nFIELD--but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their\nnumber was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly\ndefined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of\nthem. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was\nsimply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It\nwould have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary\npurposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended\nonly to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete\nobjects or physical actions.",

  "1325": {
    "p": "The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of\nthese was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of\nspeech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very\nabstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,\nadjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were\nof the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself\ninvolving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for\nexample, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which\ndid duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed\nhere: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,\nin other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning\nwere not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently\nsuppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning being\nsufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by\nadding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus\nfor example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly'. Certain\nof our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,\nwere retained, but their total number was very small. There was little\nneed for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by\nadding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,\nexcept for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was\ninvariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.",

  "1326": {
    "p": "In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word in\nthe language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be\nstrengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,\nDOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLD and\nDOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.\nIt was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of\nalmost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,\netc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous\ndiminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no\nneed for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally\nwell--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any\ncase where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide\nwhich of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,\nor LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.",

The preterite of STEAL was\nSTEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the\nlanguage, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being\nabolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.\nThe plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES.

There were\nalso certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for\nrapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable\nto be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally\ntherefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word\nor an archaic formation was retained.

Without\na full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use\nthese words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into\nOldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually\ndemanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain\novertones.

The resulting amalgam was always a\nnoun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single\nexample: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if\none chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This\ninflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,\nGOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;\nadverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.",

In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),\nfor instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)\nit came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.\nBecause of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations\nwere commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,\nthe adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,\nMINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL,\n-PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce.

Consider, for example,\nsuch a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS\nUNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this\nin Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution\ncannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English\nSocialism.' But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in\norder to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,\none would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC. And in\naddition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate\nthe full force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, enthusiastic\nacceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which was\ninextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the\nspecial function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one,\nwas not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words,\nnecessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they\ncontained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were\nsufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped\nand forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak\nDictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make\nsure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words\nthey cancelled by their existence.",

  "1333": {
    "p": "As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which had\nonce borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of\nconvenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.\nCountless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM,\nDEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket\nwords covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words\ngrouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for\ninstance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words\ngrouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism\nwere contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would have\nbeen dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar\nto that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that\nall nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need to\nknow that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the\nlike: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.\nHe knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that\nall gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat\nthe same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in\nexceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from\nit were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by\nthe two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity).\nSEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication,\nadultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal\nintercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate\nthem separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle,\nall punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific\nand technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to\ncertain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them.\nHe knew what was meant by GOODSEX--that is to say, normal intercourse\nbetween man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and\nwithout physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.\nIn Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further\nthan the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary\nwords were nonexistent.",

Some words, on the other hand,\ndisplayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of\nOceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy\nentertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses.\nOther words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when\napplied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies.

    "p": "So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have\npolitical significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The\nname of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or\ninstitution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar\nshape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number\nof syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry\nof Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith\nworked, was called RECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, the\nTeleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was not\ndone solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of\nthe twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the\ncharacteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed\nthat the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in\ntotalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such\nwords as NAZI, GESTAPO, COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginning\nthe practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak\nit was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus\nabbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by\ncutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.\nThe words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite\npicture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,\nand the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests\nmerely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine.\nIt refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in\npurpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered\nalmost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase\nover which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,\nthe associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more\ncontrollable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not\nonly for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the\nalmost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily\npronounceable.",

    "p": "In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude\nof meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it\nseemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for\npolitical purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which\ncould be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the\nspeaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from\nthe fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably\nthese words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,\nBELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others--were words of two or three\nsyllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable\nand the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at\nonce staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The\nintention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not\nideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.\nFor the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes\nnecessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to\nmake a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the\ncorrect opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.\nHis training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost\nfoolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound\nand a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of\nIngsoc, assisted the process still further.",

Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other\nlanguages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every\nyear. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,\nthe smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to\nmake articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher\nbrain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word\nDUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words in\nthe B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the\nopinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but\npraise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party\nas a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.",

They followed the same grammatical rules as the\nwords in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any\ncurrency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific\nworker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted\nto his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the\nwords occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to\nall lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science\nas a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular\nbranches.

    "p": "From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression\nof unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.\nIt was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a\nspecies of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say\nBIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely\nconveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by\nreasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas\ninimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,\nand could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and\ncondemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.\nOne could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by\nillegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For\nexample, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only\nin the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak\nsentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed\na palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or\nstrength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this\nsecondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL.\nIn 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,\nthe danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might\nremember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for\nany person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within\na couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have\nvanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no\nmore know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically\nequal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than for\ninstance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the\nsecondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many\ncrimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply\nbecause they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be\nforeseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics\nof Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growing\nfewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of\nputting them to improper uses always diminishing.",
