<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'Do you know how long you have been here?'</p><p>'I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.'</p><p>'And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?'</p><p>'To make them confess.'</p><p>'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'</p><p>'To punish them.'</p><p>'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his
face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No! Not merely to
extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have
brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,
Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands
uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have
committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is
all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.
Do you understand what I mean by that?'</p></div> </div>
