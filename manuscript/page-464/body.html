<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You will have to get used to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results that you will ever see. </p><p> There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. </p><p> It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little.</p></div> </div>
