you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first
act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'</p><p>He paused, and then went on:</p><p>'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what
your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there
can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and
insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in
your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed
everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has
not happened to you?'</p> <p>Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his
eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.</p></div> </div>
