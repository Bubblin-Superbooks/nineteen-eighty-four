They fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. </p><p> It is the achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. </p></div> </div>
