Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you. </p><p> 'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,' he said. 'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. 'I've tried all over the place. They don't exist any longer.' Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. </p><p> Actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up.</p></div> </div>
