In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. </p><p> But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old despotisms was "Thou shalt not" The command of the totalitarians was "Thou shalt" Our command is "THOU ART" No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. </p><p> Everyone is washed clean.
