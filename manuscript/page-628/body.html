Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien
had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was
certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some
sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or
other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place
where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an
expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.
When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.</p><p>'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.</p><p>'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'</p>

<p>'Do you know how long you have been here?'</p><p>'I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.'</p>
