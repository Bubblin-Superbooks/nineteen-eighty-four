Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with
a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth
was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if
he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both
Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was
a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston
began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the
watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few
necessary words in low expressionless voices.</p><p>'What time do you leave work?'</p><p>'Eighteen-thirty.'</p><p>'Where can we meet?'</p><p>'Victory Square, near the monument.'</p><p>'It's full of telescreens.'</p><p>'It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.'</p></div> </div>
