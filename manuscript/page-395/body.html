O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered
notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in
such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the
instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore
out the page and handed it to Winston.</p><p>'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'If not, my servant will

written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along
with a mass of other papers.</p></div> </div>
