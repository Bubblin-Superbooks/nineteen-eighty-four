but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged
windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps
flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound
which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or
shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the
door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden
seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.</p><p>There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they
had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also

hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six.</p></div> </div>
