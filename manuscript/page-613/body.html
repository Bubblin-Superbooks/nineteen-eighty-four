than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under
his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round

what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening,

wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although

the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and
breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.</p></div> </div>
