Everybody always confesses. You can't help it. They torture you.'</p><p>'I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do
doesn't matter: only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving

thing they can't do. They can make you say anything--ANYTHING--but they
can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you.'</p><p>'No,' he said a little more hopefully, 'no; that's quite true. They can't
get inside you. If you can FEEL that staying human is worth while, even
when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them.'</p></div> </div>
