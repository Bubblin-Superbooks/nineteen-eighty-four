and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy,
confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleep
murmuring 'Sanity is not statistical,' with the feeling that this remark
contained in it a profound wisdom.</p><p>When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time,
but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only

  But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred
  They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'</p></div> </div>
