The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat. </p><p> It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack. </p><p> Four, five, six--seven times they met during the month of June.</p></div> </div>
