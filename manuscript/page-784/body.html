Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. </p><p> For example, the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively, MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL, -PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle, however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way. </p><p> Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole.</p></div> </div>
