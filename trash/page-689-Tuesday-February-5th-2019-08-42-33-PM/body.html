<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">translations were
a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would
be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first

the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of Newspeak
had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.</p></div> </div>
